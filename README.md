# 2.1-repository
<html>
<p>
  This repository has a significant amount of things about the semester 2.1 . It is intended to ensure you disturb the class rep (me) less and less , (i mean i have a lot of CERA IMANI videos to catch up with) and give you answers to most of your questions in real time .
</p>

<p>
  This repo is like a bank of information , it contains a folder for each unit we have done this semester , each folder of each unit has four folders which are : 
         <ol>
          <li>course_outline</li>
          <li>course_work</li>
          <li>lecturer_details</li>
          <li>Notes</li>
         </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    course_outline folder contains a text file , the text file has a link to the notebook of that unit , the notebook has a lot of easter eggs to explore but the  most important stuff have already been precompiled . Important stuff in this case is stuff like mind map which is an interactive  course outline . There are other tools NOTEBOOK LM offers but that is upon you to explore. The reason for this folder is to provide course outlines for people who love course outlines and structured reading(looking at you Dan). YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT EVERY RESOURCE QUERRIED IN NOTEBOOK LM IS FROM THE LECTURER, NOT FROM MY OWN CREATIVITY , EVERY WORD IS FROM THE LECTURER AND SHOULD THEY BE INSUFFICIENT IN ANY WAY , I SHOULD NOT TAKE ANY BLAME. You are free to add your own resources though for personalized learning.
    <p>
      course_work folder contains the work we have done throughout the semester. If you want to know which assignments or cats we have done for any given unit , just check the work_done folder in the course_work and if you find you have not done any of them , just start catching up with the lecturer because it will lead to problems in the final exam , any work that we have not done will be in the pending_work folder in the course_work folder
    </p>
  <p>
    lecturer_details folder contains phone numbers and names of lecturers in case you have a missing mark after the exams or any thing else you would need. If it is not something personal like examination marks , you should go through a class rep
  </p>

<p>
  Notes folder just contains notes and or videos/class recordings for the lessons we have had
